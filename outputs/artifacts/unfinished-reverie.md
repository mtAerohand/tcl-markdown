# Unfinished Reverie

## Set Bonuses

**2-Piece Bonus:** ATK +18%.

**4-Piece Bonus:** After leaving combat for 3s, DMG dealt increased by 50%. In combat, if no Burning opponents are nearby for more than 6s, this DMG Bonus will decrease by 10% per second until it reaches 0%. When a Burning opponent exists, it will increase by 10% instead until it reaches 50%. This effect still triggers if the equipping character is off-field.
