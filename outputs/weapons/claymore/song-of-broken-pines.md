## Refinement: Rebel's Banner-Hymn

A part of the "Millennial Movement" that wanders amidst the winds. Increases ATK by **16%**/**20%**/**24%**/**28%**/**32%**, and when Normal or Charged Attacks hit opponents, the character gains a Sigil of Whispers. This effect can be triggered once every 0.3s. When you possess 4 Sigils of Whispers, all of them will be consumed and all nearby party members will obtain the "Millennial Movement: Banner-Hymn" effect for 12s. "Millennial Movement: Banner-Hymn" increases Normal ATK SPD by **12%**/**15%**/**18%**/**21%**/**24%** and increases ATK by **20%**/**25%**/**30%**/**35%**/**40%**. Once this effect is triggered, you will not gain Sigils of Whispers for 20s. Of the many effects of the "Millennial Movement," buffs of the same type will not stack.
