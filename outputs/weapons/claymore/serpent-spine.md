## Refinement: Wavesplitter

Every 4s a character is on the field, they will deal **6%**/**7%**/**8%**/**9%**/**10%** more DMG and take **3%**/**2.7%**/**2.4%**/**2.2%**/**2%** more DMG. This effect has a maximum of 5 stacks and will not be reset if the character leaves the field, but will be reduced by 1 stack when the character takes DMG.
