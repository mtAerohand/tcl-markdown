## Refinement: Parsifal the Great

DMG dealt by Charged Attacks increased by **16%**/**20%**/**24%**/**28%**/**32%**. For every party member with the same Elemental Type as the wielder (including the wielder themselves), gain 1 Gimmick stack. For every party member with a different Elemental Type from the wielder, gain 1 Theatrics stack. When the wielder has 1/2/3 or more Gimmick stacks, ATK will be increased by **16%/32%/48%** / **20%/40%/60%** / **24%/48%/72%** / **28%/56%/84%** / **32%/64%/96%**. When the wielder has 1/2/3 or more Theatrics stacks, Movement SPD will be increased by **4%/7%/10%** / **6%/9%/12%** / **8%/11%/14%** / **10%/13%/16%** / **12%/15%/18%**.
