## Refinement: Daylight's Augury

Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst DMG increased by **12%**/**15%**/**18%**/**21%**/**24%**. After a Normal Attack, Charged Attack, Elemental Skill or Elemental Burst hits an opponent, 1 stack of Ashen Nightstar will be gained for 12s. When 1/2/3/4 stacks of Ashen Nightstar are present, ATK is increased by **10/20/30/48%** / **12.5/25/37.5/60%** / **15/30/45/72%** / **17.5/35/52.5/84%** / **20/40/60/96%**. The stack of Ashen Nightstar created by the Normal Attack, Charged Attack, Elemental Skill or Elemental Burst will be counted independently of the others.
