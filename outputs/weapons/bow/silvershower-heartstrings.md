## Refinement: Dryas's Nocturne

The equipping character can gain the Remedy effect. When they possess 1/2/3 Remedy stacks, Max HP will increase by **12%/24%/40%** / **15%/30%/50%** / **18%/36%/60%** / **21%/42%/70%** / **24%/48%/80%**. 1 stack may be gained when the following conditions are met: 1 stack for 25s when using an Elemental Skill; 1 stack for 25s when the value of a Bond of Life value increases; 1 stack for 20s for performing healing. Stacks can still be triggered when the equipping character is not on the field. Each stack's duration is counted independently. In addition, when 3 stacks are active, Elemental Burst CRIT Rate will be increased by **28%**/**35%**/**42%**/**49%**/**56%**. This effect will be canceled 4s after falling under 3 stacks.
