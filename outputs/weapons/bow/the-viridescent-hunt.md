## Refinement: Verdant Wind

Upon hit, Normal and Charged Attacks have a 50% chance to generate a Cyclone, which will continuously attract surrounding opponents, dealing **40%**/**50%**/**60%**/**70%**/**80%** of ATK as DMG to these opponents every 0.5s for 4s. This effect can only occur once every **14**/**13**/**12**/**11**/**10**s.
