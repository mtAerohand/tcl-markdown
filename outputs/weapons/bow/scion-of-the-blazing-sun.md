## Refinement: The Way of Sunfire

After a Charged Attack hits an opponent, a Sunfire Arrow will descend upon the opponent hit, dealing **60%**/**75%**/**90%**/**105%**/**120%** ATK as DMG, and applying the Heartsearer effect to the opponent damaged by said Arrow for 10s. Opponents affected by Heartsearer take **28%**/**35%**/**42%**/**49%**/**56%** more Charged Attack DMG from the wielder. A Sunfire Arrow can be triggered once every 10s.
