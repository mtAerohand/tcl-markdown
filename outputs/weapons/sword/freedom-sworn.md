## Refinement: Revolutionary Chorale

A part of the "Millennial Movement" that wanders amidst the winds. Increases DMG by **10%**/**12.5%**/**15%**/**17.5%**/**20%**. When the character wielding this weapon triggers Elemental Reactions, they gain a Sigil of Rebellion. This effect can be triggered once every 0.5s and can be triggered even if said character is not on the field. When you possess 2 Sigils of Rebellion, all of them will be consumed and all nearby party members will obtain "Millennial Movement: Song of Resistance" for 12s. "Millennial Movement: Song of Resistance" increases Normal, Charged and Plunging Attack DMG by **16%**/**20%**/**24%**/**28%**/**32%** and increases ATK by **20%**/**25%**/**30%**/**35%**/**40%**. Once this effect is triggered, you will not gain Sigils of Rebellion for 20s. Of the many effects of the "Millennial Movement," buffs of the same type will not stack.
