## Refinement: Bright Dawn Overture

ATK increased by **15%**/**19%**/**23%**/**27%**/**31%**. After the equipping character triggers Burning on an opponent or deals Dendro DMG to Burning opponents, the DMG dealt is increased by **18%**/**23%**/**28%**/**33%**/**38%**. This effect lasts for 8s, max 2 stacks. When 2 stacks are reached or when the duration is refreshed at 2 stacks, restore **12**/**13**/**14**/**15**/**16** Energy. Energy can be restored this way once every 12s. The 2 aforementioned effects can be triggered even when the character is off-field.
