## Refinement: Seasoned Symphony

ATK is increased by **12%**/**15%**/**18%**/**21%**/**24%**. When the equipping character is off-field, ATK is increased by an additional **12%**/**15%**/**18%**/**21%**/**24%**. After initiating healing, the equipping character and the character(s) they have healed will obtain the "Sweet Echoes" effect, increasing their ATK by **32%**/**40%**/**48%**/**56%**/**64%** for 3s. This effect can be triggered even if the equipping character is off-field.
