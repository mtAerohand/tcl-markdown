## Refinement: Frost Burial

Hitting an opponent with Normal and Charged Attacks has a **60%**/**70%**/**80%**/**90%**/**100%** chance of forming and dropping an Everfrost Icicle above them, dealing AoE DMG equal to **80%**/**95%**/**110%**/**125%**/**140%** of ATK. Opponents affected by Cryo are instead dealt DMG equal to **200%**/**240%**/**280%**/**320%**/**360%** of ATK. Can only occur once every 10s.
