## Refinement: Cloudfall Axiom

After the equipping character hits an opponent with a Plunging Attack, all nearby party members' Plunging Attacks will deal **28%**/**41%**/**54%**/**67%**/**80%** increased DMG for 20s. When nearby party members hit opponents with Plunging Attacks, they will restore **2.5**/**2.75**/**3**/**3.25**/**3.5** Energy to the equipping character. Energy can be restored this way every 0.7s. This energy regain effect can be triggered even if the equipping character is not on the field.
