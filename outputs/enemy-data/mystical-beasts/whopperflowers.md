## Interactions

Whopperflowers will sometimes be found disguised as other flowers around the world.
The dormant whopperflower will not attack on its own, but if the player picks up the fake flower it will awaken and begin combat.
Those fake flowers can be spotted easily as they:

1. Have no shining sparkle effect to them.
2. Do not appear white under the Elemental vision effect.
3. Once in range to pick up, their icon left from the name text will be replaced with a chatting bubble.
