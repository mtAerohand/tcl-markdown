# Enemy Shields and Armor

## Introduction

Currently, there are two main types of shields that players should be aware of, **Elemental Shields** and **Elemental Armor**. We'll talk about what the differences are between these two shield types, as well as how to eliminate them. **An understanding of Gauge units and ICD is required.**

**Elemental Shield strength varies from domains, abyss, Co-op, and overworld. Testing was done in overworld using level 1 Weapons and no Artifacts.**

## Elemental Armor

**Elemental Armor** is the type of shield that protects mobs such as **Stonehide Lawachurl, Fatui, Geo Slimes, and Regisvine bosses.**

One thing to remember is that unlike **Elemental Shields**, it is possible to deal direct damage to enemies protected by **Elemental Armor**. However, the enemy gains +100% RES to Elemental attacks and Physical attacks while armored, which comes out to a total of 110% Elemental RES and 80% Physical RES.

The **Elemental Armor** surrounding specifically **Fatui Agents** works in a unique way. Unlike other shield types, they are only damaged by the **Specific Element** that counters them. For instance, an **Electro Fatuus' Elemental Armor** will only take damage if inflicted by **Cryo Element.** Other elements deal extremely insignificant damage that it is practically negligible.

The following are tables consisting of different types of **Elemental Armor** as well as how to take them down:

### Lawachurls

Note that both **Stonehide Lawachurl**, **Thunderhelm Lawachurl**, and **Frostarm Lawachurl** armor decays each second for up to 90 seconds.

### Regisvines

**IMPORTANT:** These values are for **Aura** applied to the **Core** of the **Regisvine.** It takes **HALF** the **GU** of each Element to break the shield protecting the **COROLLA**. So for example, it only takes **6GU Electro** to break the eye of either **Regisvine.**

## Mitachurl Shields

**Mitachurl Shields** are rather different than other types of shields. For one, they only protect the **Mitachurls** from **one direction only.** There aren't any special mechanics as to how they work, and dealing with them is quite simple as well.

## Childe

During the Childe boss fight, he can enter into a shielded state where he takes no damage. This shield is only affected by poise damage and not normal damage. Attacks like **Claymore Attacks, Blunt Attribute attacks, and Overload** will be the most effective at breaking said shield.

## Shield Damage

Genshin Impact does not use a generic single-variable HP system for enemy shields like other games. Instead, total Shield HP is in the form of its **Shield** **Gauge Units \(Shield GU\)**, a value which represents the shield’s “Elemental strength”. This can be decreased to **0** \(thereby breaking the shield\) through reactions, character damage \(excluding Elemental Armor shields\) and the Poise values of your talents. _\(Poise values are explained in the document and affect Geo_ _/ Frozen shields only\)_

Total Shield Damage = Reaction Cost + Damage Cost + Poise Cost

Additional notes on shield damage:

* Transformative damage is also applied in the damage cost of shield damage, and is affected by Elemental mastery.
