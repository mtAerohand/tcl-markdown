## Attack Mechanics

- By holding the attack button with good timing it is possible to infinitely extend the spin CA. While other characters can achieve this through menuing, Freminet can do this without any menus. Can be performed after N1, N2 or N3

## Skill Mechanics

- Energy gen: Freminet energy gen is 2 particles on the upthrust of his E, but never his down thrust on Shattering Pressure LVL0-3. On level 4 Shattering Pressure, he generates 1 particle on hit. During burst, he generates 1 particle on upthrust, and 1 particle on level 4 Shattering Pressure - @emmaus

  - https://youtu.be/jyFjgVHX5zc (Level 4)
  - https://youtu.be/nOQPdFS5yYc (Level 4, burst)
- Freminet's Skill cooldown starts on its first cast. In the attached footage, it is possible to see that the remaining cooldown displayed after the 2nd Skill cast is lower according to the time that has passed since activating Pers Timer. - @polomo
- The Pers Timer state persists through swaps - https://youtu.be/ZgVjnbyOhSI - @polomo
- If you jump or fall from any height after you reach 4 stacks with his E, you will be able to keep doing normal attacks despite being at full stacks, and you can only E2 by pressing E again - https://imgur.com/a/zIyHFuZ https://imgur.com/a/UFi31on - @f99shi
