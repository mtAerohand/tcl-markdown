While the Hu Tao boost is active, Ulting with Rosaria increases Diona's CR to **52.5%** meaning that Rosaria's A4 is giving Diona **10.6%** CR. This is an **additional 1.8% CR** when compared to the CRIT sharing uninfluenced by Hu Tao.

**Significance:**  
This confirms that anything which influences a character's CRIT stats found in the details tab will influence the CRIT Sharing that Rosaria offers

**Finding:**

**Significance:**  
The description is misleading, and you can actually maintain 100% uptime on this Physical RES Shred.

### Pale Flame on Rosaria

**Finding:**  
2 stacks of the Pale Flame 4-Piece set bonus cannot be achieved by 1 use of Rosaria's Skill despite the Skill being 2 hits \(probably because the 2 hits are within 0.3s\), and requires back to back usage to achieve the full 4-Piece effect.

**Evidence:**  
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPQqnZv0qLk)  
Also hitlag on Mitachurl shields [wooden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Jd4QWFFavY) and [geo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klxD_F9Widg) still only grants you one stack per Skill use.

**Significance:**  
This makes 4-Piece Pale Flame stacks somewhat difficult to maintain for carry Rosaria with, since her Skill CD is 6s and Pale Flame stacks last for 7s.
