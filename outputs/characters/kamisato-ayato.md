### Elemental Skill: Kamisato Art: Kyouka

Kamisato Ayato shifts positions and enters the Takimeguri Kanka state.
After this shift, he will leave a watery illusion at his original location. After it is formed, the watery illusion will explode if opponents are nearby or after its duration ends, dealing **AoE Hydro DMG**.

**Takimeguri Kanka**
In this state, Kamisato Ayato uses his Shunsuiken to engage in blindingly fast attacks, causing DMG from his Normal Attacks to be converted into **AoE Hydro DMG**. This cannot be overridden.
It also has the following properties:
·After a Shunsuiken attack hits an opponent, it will grant Ayato the Namisen effect, increasing the DMG dealt by Shunsuiken based on Ayato's current Max HP. The initial maximum number of Namisen stacks is 4, and 1 stack can be gained through Shunsuiken every 0.1s. This effect will be dispelled when Takimeguri Kanka ends.
·Kamisato Ayato's resistance to interruption is increased.
·Unable to use Charged or Plunging Attacks.

Takimeguri Kanka will be cleared when Ayato leaves the field. Using Kamisato Art: Kyouka again while in the Takimeguri Kanka state will reset and replace the pre-existing state.

**"When, I wonder, did you come under the illusion that you were winning?"**
**— Ayato is like this in both matter of martial prowess and political intrigue, but to preserve the dignity of his fellow Commissioners, he does not say such things to them. As such, only Thoma, Itto, and Ayaka have ever heard this line.**

Unveils a garden of purity that silences the cacophony within.
