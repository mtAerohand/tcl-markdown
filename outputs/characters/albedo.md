### Elemental Skill: Abiogenesis: Solar Isotoma

Albedo creates a Solar Isotoma using alchemy, which deals **AoE Geo DMG** on appearance.

**Solar Isotoma**
has the following properties:
·When opponents within the Solar Isotoma field take DMG, the Solar Isotoma will generate Transient Blossoms which deal **AoE Geo DMG**. DMG dealt scales off Albedo's DEF. 
·Transient Blossoms can only be generated once every 2s.
·When a character is located at the locus of the Solar Isotoma, the Solar Isotoma will accumulate Geo power to form a crystallized platform that lifts the character up to a certain height. Only one crystallized platform can exist at a time.
·Solar Isotoma is considered a **Geo construct**. Only one Solar Isotoma created by Albedo himself can exist at a time. 

**Hold** to designate the location of the skill.

**This Geo bloom has an unusual property mirrored in the aim of alchemy. To rise from the earth, soar into the sky, and become the sun.**

### Elemental Burst: Rite of Progeniture: Tectonic Tide

Under Albedo's command, Geo crystals surge and burst forth, dealing **AoE Geo DMG** in front of him.
If a Solar Isotoma created by Albedo himself is on the field, 7 Fatal Blossoms will be generated in the Solar Isotoma field, bursting violently into bloom and dealing **AoE Geo DMG**.

Tectonic Tide DMG and Fatal Blossom DMG will not generate Transient Blossoms.

**Under the Kreideprinz's command, the tectonic tide of creation seethes into life.**
