### Elemental Skill: Hanega: Song of the Wind

Concentrates the power of the winds to break free from the shackles of the earth, dealing **AoE Anemo DMG** before leaping into the air and entering the Windfavored state.

**Windfavored**
The Wanderer cannot perform Plunging Attacks in this state. When he uses Normal and Charged Attacks, they will be converted into Kuugo: Fushoudan and Kuugo: Toufukai respectively; the DMG they deal and their AoE will be increased, and their DMG will be considered Normal and Charged Attack DMG respectively. Kuugo: Toufukai will not consume Stamina.
The Wanderer will hover persistently during this time. While this state is active, the Wanderer's movements gain the following properties:
·Persistently consumes Kuugoryoku Points to maintain this hovering state.
·When sprinting, additional Kuugoryoku Points will be consumed for the Wanderer to accelerate mid-air. Holding sprint will cause persistent Kuugoryoku Point consumption to maintain speed. This effect will replace his default sprint.
·Jumping expends extra Kuugoryoku Points to increase hovering height. Holding jump will cause persistent Kuugoryoku Point consumption to keep increasing hovering height.

Running out of Kuugoryoku Points will end the Windfavored state.
A second cast during the duration of Windfavored will also end it.

**"The world dances in a weightless whirl, presenting a secret that can only be found in the flowers."**
