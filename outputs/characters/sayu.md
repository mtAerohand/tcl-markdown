### Elemental Skill: Yoohoo Art: Fuuin Dash

The special technique of the Yoohoo Ninja Arts!
Sayu curls up into a rolling Fuufuu Windwheel and smashes into opponents at high speed, dealing **Anemo DMG**. When the duration ends, she unleashes a Fuufuu Whirlwind Kick, dealing **AoE Anemo DMG**.

**#Press**
Enters the Fuufuu Windwheel state, rolling forward a short distance before using the Fuufuu Whirlwind Kick.

**Hold**
Rolls about continuously in the Fuufuu Windwheel state, increasing Sayu's resistance to interruption while within that state.
During this time, Sayu can control the direction of her roll, and can use the skill again to end her Windwheel state early and unleash a stronger version of the Fuufuu Whirlwind Kick.
The Hold version of this skill can trigger Elemental Absorption.

This skill has a maximum duration of 10s and enters CD once its effects end. The longer Sayu remains in her Windwheel state, the longer the CD.

**Elemental Absorption**
If Sayu comes into contact with **Hydro**/**Pyro**/**Cryo**/**Electro** while in her Windwheel state, she will deal additional elemental DMG of that type.
Elemental Absorption may only occur once per use of this skill.

**Sayu can pull this skill off with her eyes closed. This technique was originally created for escaping, but now that she's got a Vision, might as well make her foes eat dirt while she's at it.**

### Elemental Burst: Yoohoo Art: Mujina Flurry

The other super special technique of the Yoohoo Ninja Arts! It summons a pair of helping hands for Sayu.
Deals **Anemo DMG** to nearby opponents and heals all nearby party members. The amount of HP restored is based on Sayu's ATK. This skill then summons a Muji-Muji Daruma.

**Muji-Muji Daruma**
At specific intervals, the Daruma will take one of several actions based on the situation around it:
·If the HP of nearby characters is above 70%, it will attack a nearby opponent, dealing **Anemo DMG**.
·If there are active characters with 70% or less HP nearby, it will heal the active character with the lowest percentage HP left. If there are no opponents nearby, it will heal active characters nearby even if they have 70% HP or more.

**People who don't know the first thing about ninjutsu love to watch Sayu show off this skill, and some have tried to learn it from her. But Sayu just wants to sleep and not be disturbed.**
