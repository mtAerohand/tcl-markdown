### Elemental Skill: Nights of Formal Focus

Puts forth a shield known as the Curtain of Slumber, dealing **AoE Cryo DMG**.
The Curtain of Slumber's DMG Absorption is based on Layla's Max HP and absorbs **Cryo DMG** with 250% effectiveness. When the shield is deployed, Layla will have **Cryo** applied to her briefly.

**Night Stars and Shooting Stars**
While the Curtain of Slumber is active, it will create 1 Night Star that will be attached to it every 1.5s. When a character protected by this shield uses an Elemental Skill, 2 Night Stars will be created. Night Stars can be created once every 0.3s in this way. A maximum of 4 Night Stars can be accumulated at any one time.
Once the Curtain of Slumber has accumulated 4 Night Stars and there are opponents nearby, these Night Stars will transform into homing Shooting Stars that will be fired off in sequence, dealing **Cryo DMG** to any opponents hit.
If the Curtain of Slumber's duration ends or it is destroyed, the Night Stars will disappear. If they are already being fired off as Shooting Stars, these Shooting Stars will last until this wave of shots ends.

New Night Stars cannot be created until the previous wave of Shooting Stars has been fired completely.

**"She and I are like two master artisans who have never met, yet who sit at the same cushioned seat, embroidering the same dream-flower."**
