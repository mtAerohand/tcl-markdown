### Elemental Skill: Wind Realm of Nasamjnin

Faruzan deploys a polyhedron that deals **AoE Anemo DMG** to nearby opponents. She will also enter the Manifest Gale state.
While in the Manifest Gale state, Faruzan's next fully charged shot will consume this state and will become a Hurricane Arrow that contains high-pressure currents. This arrow deals **Anemo DMG** based on the DMG of a fully charged Aimed Shot from "Normal Attack: Parthian Shot."

**Pressurized Collapse**
The Hurricane Arrow will apply a Pressurized Collapse effect to the opponent or character hit. This effect will be removed after a short delay, creating a vortex that deals **AoE Anemo DMG** and pulls nearby objects and opponents in. If the Hurricane Arrow does not hit any opponent or character, it will create a Pressurized Collapse effect at its point of impact.
The vortex DMG is considered Elemental Skill DMG.

**The winds of truth buffet the spirits of those who seek truth, dispersing the miasma of preconception.**
