### Elemental Skill: Universality: An Elaboration on Form

Rushes forward, dealing **Dendro DMG** to nearby opponents when the rush ends, causing a Chisel-Light Mirror to form.
Holding this skill will cause it to behave differently.

**Hold**
Enters Aiming Mode to adjust the direction of Alhaitham's rush attack.

**Chisel-Light Mirror**
When this skill is unleashed, Alhaitham will generate 1 Chisel-Light Mirror. If there are no Mirrors at this time, he will generate 1 additional Mirror. Chisel-Light Mirrors will have the following properties:
·When he possesses Chisel-Light Mirrors, Alhaitham's Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks will be converted to **Dendro DMG**. This cannot be overridden.
·When attacks of the aforementioned kind hit opponents, the Chisel-Light Mirrors will unleash a Projection Attack that deals **AoE Dendro DMG** based on the number of Mirrors on the field.
·A total of 3 Chisel-Light Mirrors can exist at once.
·The Chisel-Light Mirrors will disappear one after the other over time, and will all disappear when Alhaitham leaves the field.
