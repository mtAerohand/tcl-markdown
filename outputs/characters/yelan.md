**Normal Attack**
Performs up to 4 consecutive shots with a bow.

While aiming, flowing water will accumulate on the arrowhead. A fully charged torrential arrow will deal **Hydro DMG**.

**Breakthrough**
Yelan will enter a "Breakthrough" state after spending 5s out of combat, which will cause her next Charged Aimed Shot to have 80% decreased charge time, and once charged, she can fire a "Breakthrough Barb" that will deal **AoE Hydro DMG** based on Yelan's Max HP.

**Plunging Attack**
Fires off a shower of arrows in mid-air before falling and striking the ground, dealing AoE DMG upon impact.

### Elemental Skill: Lingering Lifeline

Fires off a Lifeline that allows her to move rapidly, entangling and marking opponents along its path.
When this rapid movement ends, the Lifeline will explode, dealing **Hydro DMG** to the marked opponents based on Yelan's Max HP.

**Tap**
Moves a certain distance forward swiftly.

**Hold**
Engages in continuous, swift movement, during which Yelan's resistance to interruption is increased.
During this time, Yelan can control this rapid movement and end it by using this Skill again.

Additionally, each opponent marked by the Lifeline when it explodes grants Yelan a 34% chance to reset her Breakthrough state.

**Not until she begins to tug on the strings do evildoers, crooks, and scheming villains alike know that there is no escape.**

## Passive Talents

### Turn Control

When the party has 1/2/3/4 Elemental Types, Yelan's Max HP is increased by 6%/12%/18%/30%.

### Adapt With Ease

So long as an **Exquisite Throw** is in play, your own active character deals 1% more DMG. This increases by a further 3.5% DMG every second. The maximum increase to DMG dealt is 50%.
The pre-existing effect will be dispelled if Depth-Clarion Dice is recast during its duration.

### Necessary Calculation

Gains 25% more rewards when dispatched on a Liyue Expedition for 20 hours.

Increases the Level of **Depth-Clarion Dice** by 3.

### C5: Dealer's Sleight

Increases the Level of **Lingering Lifeline** by 3.
Maximum upgrade level is 15.

### C6: Winner Takes All

In this state, all of Yelan's Normal Attacks will be special Breakthrough Barbs. These Breakthrough Barbs will have similar abilities to normal ones and the DMG dealt will be considered Charged Attack DMG, dealing 156% of a normal Breakthrough Barb's DMG.

The Mastermind state lasts 20s and will be cleared after Yelan fires 5 arrows.
