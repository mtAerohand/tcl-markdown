### Elemental Skill: Icefang Rush

Adjusting his breathing, rhythm, and pace, Wriothesley sprints forward a short distance, entering the **Chilling Penalty** state and unleashing more powerful attacks than before.

**Chilling Penalty**
·Increases Wriothesley's interruption resistance
·When his HP is above 50%, it will enhance the Repelling Fists of **Normal Attack: Forceful Fists of Frost** and increase its DMG. When such an attack hits, it will consume a fixed amount of Wriothesley's HP. HP can be lost this way once every 0.1s.
This effect will be canceled should Wriothesley leave the field.

**"Past convictions are past. It is our future choices that we must grasp."
"Defy your fate, or else this glutton be, to pay your fate's due, by the crime and thee."**

### Elemental Burst: Darkgold Wolfbite

Activating his boxing gloves, Wriothesley strikes out with an icy straight, then uses Icicle Impact to cause multiple instances of **AoE Cryo DMG** in a frontal area.

**Arkhe: Ousia**
After Icicle Impact ends, a Surging Blade will descend upon the opponent's position, dealing Ousia-aligned **Cryo DMG**.

**There are some things that even the Duke of the Fortress of Meropide can do little about — for example, complicated paperwork, the trivialities of a supervisor, or even... little kids pasting a whole host of cute but difficult-to-remove stickers on his boxing gloves.**

You can gain a Gracious Rebuke this way once every 5s.

### There Shall Be a Reckoning for Sin

Additionally, Rebuke: Vaulting Fist will obtain the following enhancement:
