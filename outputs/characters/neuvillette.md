## Talents

### Normal Attack: As Water Seeks Equilibrium

**Normal Attack**
With light flourishes, Neuvillette commands the tides to unleash a maximum of 3 attacks, dealing **Hydro DMG**.

**Charged Attack Empowerment: Legal Evaluation**
While charging up, Neuvillette will gather the power of water, forming it into a Seal of Arbitration. In this state, Neuvillette can move and change facing, and also absorb any Sourcewater Droplets in a certain AoE.
Every Droplet he absorbs will increase the formation speed of the Seal, and will heal Neuvillette.
When the charging is stopped, if the Symbol has yet to be formed, then a Charged Attack will be unleashed. If it has been formed, then a Charged Attack: Equitable Judgment will be unleashed.

**Charged Attack**
Consumes a fixed amount of Stamina to attack opponents with a rupturing blast of water, dealing **AoE Hydro DMG**.

**Charged Attack: Equitable Judgment**
Unleashes surging torrents, dealing continuous **AoE Hydro DMG** to all opponents in a straight-line area in front of him.
Equitable Judgment will not consume any Stamina and lasts 3s.
If Neuvillette's HP is above 50%, he will continuously lose HP while using this attack.

**Plunging Attack**
Gathering the might of Hydro, Neuvillette plunges towards the ground from mid-air, damaging all opponents in his path. Deals **AoE Hydro DMG** upon impact with the ground.
