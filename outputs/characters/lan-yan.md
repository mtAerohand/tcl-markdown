### Elemental Skill: Swallow-Wisp Pinion Dance

Summoning forth the Swallow-Wisp Shield, a secret art passed down across generations, Lan Yan dashes forward and, upon making contact with her target, will leap back into the air.
The Swallow-Wisp Shield's DMG absorption scales based on her ATK, and has a 250% absorption efficiency against **Anemo DMG**.
While in mid-air due to the effects of her Elemental Skill: Swallow-Wisp Pinion Dance, pressing her Elemental Skill again or pressing Normal Attack will cause Lan Yan to hurl her Feathermoon Rings at an opponent, and they will spin between nearby opponents twice upon hit, dealing **Anemo DMG**.
Holding the Skill will cause it to behave differently.

**Hold**
Enter Aiming Mode to adjust the dash direction.

**"The clouds cut the lunar light, like shadows silver gracing one's sight."**

### Elemental Burst: Lustrous Moonrise

Lan Yan creates a Feathermoon Swallow Array, pulling in nearby opponents and objects and dealing multiple instances of **AoE Anemo DMG**.

**Strictly speaking, with only Lan Yan herself present, it cannot properly be called an "array." However, if her Rattan Figures are brought into the picture, she can sort of fulfill the requirements... Probably.**
