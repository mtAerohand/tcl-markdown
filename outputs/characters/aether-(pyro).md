### Elemental Skill: Flowfire Blade

Wields a searing flame that can incinerate the very earth. Has different effects when Tapped or Held.

**Tap**
Call forth flames in a raging blaze. When used, the Traveler gains 42 Nightsoul points and enters the Nightsoul's Blessing state, summoning a Blazing Threshold that follows the current active character.
When the Blazing Threshold gets close to opponents, it will deal Nightsoul-aligned **Pyro DMG** to nearby opponents at intervals.

**Hold**
Unleash fire in a composed manner, dealing Nightsoul-aligned **AoE Pyro DMG** to nearby opponents. When used, the Traveler gains 42 Nightsoul points and enters the Nightsoul's Blessing state, summoning a Scorching Threshold that follows the current active character.
When the current active character within a Scorching Threshold deals DMG to opponents, the Threshold will launch a Coordinated Attack that deals Nightsoul-aligned **Pyro DMG** based on the Traveler's ATK. This effect can occur once every 3s.

**Nightsoul's Blessing: Traveler**
Continuously consumes Nightsoul points. The Traveler's Nightsoul's Blessing state lasts 12s at maximum, and when their Nightsoul points are exhausted, this state will end. If this Elemental Skill is used again while active, the Traveler's Nightsoul points will be reset to 42 points.
Blazing and Scorching Thresholds will disappear once the Traveler's Nightsoul's Blessing state ends, and only 1 Blazing or Scorching Threshold summoned by the Traveler themselves can exist at any one time.

**Together, you and Paimon watched the shifting colors of the flowing flames.**
