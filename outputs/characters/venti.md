### Elemental Skill: Skyward Sonnet

O wind upon which all hymns and songs fly, bear these earth-walkers up into the sky!

**#Press**
Summons a Wind Domain at the opponent's location, dealing **AoE Anemo DMG** and launching opponents into the air.

**Hold**
Summons an even larger Wind Domain with Venti as the epicenter, dealing **AoE Anemo DMG** and launching affected opponents into the air.
After unleashing the Hold version of this ability, Venti rides the wind into the air.

**In the days when gods and men walked the earth together, the heavens were filled with countless songs. This melody has long since been forgotten.**
