### Elemental Skill: Sweeping Fervor

Xinyan brandishes her instrument, dealing **Pyro DMG** on nearby opponents, forming a shield made out of her audience's passion.
The shield's DMG Absorption scales based on Xinyan's DEF and on the number of opponents hit.
·Hitting 0–1 opponents grants Shield Level 1: Ad Lib.
·Hitting 2 opponents grants Shield Level 2: Lead-In.
·Hitting 3 or more opponents grants Shield Level 3: Rave, which will also deal intermittent **Pyro DMG** to nearby opponents.

The shield has the following special properties:
·When unleashed, it infuses Xinyan with **Pyro**.
·It has 250% DMG Absorption effectiveness against **Pyro DMG**.

**Xinyan insists that these pyrotechnics are the apex of performative art, and that they are physical phenomena that have nothing to do with her Vision.**

Strumming rapidly, Xinyan launches nearby opponents and deals Physical DMG to them, hyping up the crowd.
