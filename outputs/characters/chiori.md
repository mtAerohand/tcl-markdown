### Elemental Skill: Fluttering Hasode

Dashes nimbly forward with silken steps. Once this dash ends, Chiori will summon the automaton doll "Tamoto" beside her and sweep her blade upward, dealing **AoE Geo DMG** to nearby opponents based on her ATK and DEF.
Holding the Skill will cause it to behave differently.

**Hold**
Enter Aiming Mode to adjust the dash direction.

**Tamoto**
· Will slash at nearby opponents at intervals, dealing **AoE Geo DMG** based on Chiori's ATK and DEF.
· While active, if there are nearby **Geo Construct(s)** or **Geo Construct(s)** are created nearby, an additional Tamoto will be summoned next to your active character. Only 1 additional Tamoto can be summoned in this manner, and its duration is independently counted.

**"Sakura red dyes the brocade, the fragrance suffuses the sleeves, the orioles intoxicated."**

### Elemental Burst: Hiyoku: Twin Blades

**"Master one principle, and the path to all others shall open to you."**

## Passive Talents

### Tailor-Made

Gain different effects depending on the next action you take within a short duration after using **Fluttering Hasode**'s upward sweep. If you #Press the Elemental Skill, you will trigger the Tapestry effect. If you #Press your Normal Attack, the Tailoring effect will be triggered instead.

**Tapestry**
· Switches to the next character in your roster.
· Grants all your party members "Seize the Moment": When your active party member's Normal Attacks, Charged Attacks, and Plunging Attacks hit a nearby opponent, "Tamoto" will execute a coordinated attack, dealing 100% of Fluttering Hasode's upward sweep DMG as **AoE Geo DMG** at the opponent's location. DMG dealt this way is considered Elemental Skill DMG.
· "Seize the Moment" lasts 8s, and 1 of "Tamoto"'s coordinated attack can be unleashed every 2s. 2 such coordinated attacks can occur per "Seize the Moment" effect duration.

**Tailoring**
· Chiori gains **Geo infusion** for 5s.

When on the field, if Chiori does not either #Press her Elemental Skill or use a Normal Attack within a short time after using Fluttering Hasode's upward sweep, the Tailoring effect will be triggered by default.

### The Finishing Touch

When a nearby party member creates a **Geo Construct**, Chiori will gain 20% **Geo DMG Bonus** for 20s.

### Brocaded Collar's Beauteous Silhouette

When any party member is wearing an outfit apart from their default outfit, or is wearing a wind glider other than the Wings of First Flight, your party members will obtain the Swift Stride effect: Movement SPD is increased by 10%.
This effect does not take effect in Domains, Trounce Domains, and the Spiral Abyss. Swift Stride does not stack.

## Constellations

### C1: Six Paths of Sage Silkcraft

The AoE of the automaton doll "Tamoto" summoned by **Fluttering Hasode** is increased by 50%.
Additionally, if there is a **Geo** party member other than Chiori, Fluttering Hasode will trigger the following after the dash is completed:
· Summon an additional Tamoto. Only one additional Tamoto can exist at the same time, whether summoned by Chiori this way or through the presence of a Geo Construct.
· Triggers the Passive Talent "The Finishing Touch." This effect requires you to first unlock the Passive Talent "The Finishing Touch."

### C2: In Five Colors Dyed

For 10s after using **Hiyoku: Twin Blades**, a simplified automaton doll, "Kinu," will be summoned next to your active character every 3s. Kinu will attack nearby opponents, dealing **AoE Geo DMG** equivalent to 170% of Tamoto's DMG. DMG dealt this way is considered Elemental Skill DMG.
Kinu will leave the field after 1 attack or after lasting 3s.

### C3: Four Brocade Embellishments

Increases the Level of **Fluttering Hasode** by 3.
Maximum upgrade level is 15.

### C4: A Tailor's Three Courtesies

For 8s after triggering either follow-up effect of the Passive Talent "Tailor-Made," when your current active character's Normal, Charged, or Plunging Attacks hit a nearby opponent, a simplified automaton doll, "Kinu," will be summoned near this opponent. You can summon 1 Kinu every 1s in this way, and up to 3 Kinu may be summoned this way during each instance of "Tailor-Made"'s Seize the Moment or Tailoring effect. The above effect can be triggered up to once every 15s.
Must unlock the Passive Talent "Tailor-Made" first.

### C5: Two Silken Plumules

Increases the Level of **Hiyoku: Twin Blades** by 3.
Maximum upgrade level is 15.

### C6: Sole Principle Pursuit

After triggering a follow-up effect of the Passive Talent "Tailor-Made," Chiori's own **Fluttering Hasode**'s CD is decreased by 12s. Must unlock the Passive "Tailor-Made" first.
In addition, the DMG dealt by Chiori's own Normal Attacks is increased by an amount equal to 235% of her own DEF.
