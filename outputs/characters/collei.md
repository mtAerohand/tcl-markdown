## Passive Talents

### Floral Sidewinder

If one of your party members has triggered Burning, Quicken, Aggravate, Spread, Bloom, Hyperbloom, or Burgeon reactions before the **Floral Ring** returns, it will grant the character the Sprout effect upon return, which will continuously deal **Dendro DMG** equivalent to 40% of Collei's ATK to nearby opponents for 3s.
If another Sprout effect is triggered during its initial duration, the initial effect will be removed. DMG dealt by Sprout is considered Elemental Skill DMG.

### The Languid Wood

When a character within the **Cuilein-Anbar Zone** triggers Burning, Quicken, Aggravate, Spread, Bloom, Hyperbloom, or Burgeon reactions, the Zone's duration will be increased by 1s.
A single **Trump-Card Kitty** can be extended this way by up to 3s.

The Passive Talent Floral Sidewinder is changed to this:
The **Floral Ring** will grant the character the Sprout effect from Floral Sidewinder upon return, dealing 40% of Collei's ATK as **Dendro DMG** to nearby opponents for 3s.
From the moment of using **Floral Brush** to the moment when this instance of Sprout effect ends, if any of your party members triggers Burning, Quicken, Aggravate, Spread, Bloom, Hyperbloom, or Burgeon reactions, the Sprout effect will be extended by 3s.
The Sprout effect can only be extended this way once. If another Sprout effect is triggered during its initial duration, the initial effect will be removed. DMG dealt by Sprout is considered Elemental Skill DMG.
