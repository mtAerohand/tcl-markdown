### Elemental Skill: Transcendence: Baleful Omen

The Raiden Shogun unveils a shard of her Euthymia, dealing **Electro DMG** to nearby opponents, and granting nearby party members the Eye of Stormy Judgment.

**Eye of Stormy Judgment**
·When characters with this buff attack and deal DMG to opponents, the Eye will unleash a coordinated attack, dealing **AoE Electro DMG** at the opponent's position.
·Characters who gain the Eye of Stormy Judgment will have their Elemental Burst DMG increased based on the Energy Cost of the Elemental Burst during the Eye's duration.

The Eye can initiate one coordinated attack every 0.9s per party.
Coordinated attacks generated by characters not controlled by you deal 20% of the normal DMG.

**Beings of great divinity might affect all that they survey, and the Electro Archon can manipulate the very inauspicious stars themselves to defend her retainers and bring a thundering sentence down on their foes.**

### Elemental Burst: Secret Art: Musou Shinsetsu

Gathering truths unnumbered and wishes uncounted, the Raiden Shogun unleashes the Musou no Hitotachi and deals **AoE Electro DMG**, using Musou Isshin in combat for a certain duration afterward. The DMG dealt by Musou no Hitotachi and Musou Isshin's attacks will be increased based on the number of Chakra Desiderata's Resolve stacks consumed when this skill is used.

**Musou Isshin**
While in this state, the Raiden Shogun will wield her tachi in battle, while her Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks will be infused with **Electro DMG**, which cannot be overridden. When such attacks hit opponents, she will regenerate Energy for all nearby party members. Energy can be restored this way once every 1s, and this effect can be triggered 5 times throughout this skill's duration.
While in this state, the Raiden Shogun's resistance to interruption is increased, and she is immune to **Electro-Charged** reaction DMG.
While Musou Isshin is active, the Raiden Shogun's Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attack DMG will be considered Elemental Burst DMG.

The effects of Musou Isshin will be cleared when the Raiden Shogun leaves the field.

**Chakra Desiderata**
When nearby party members (excluding the Raiden Shogun herself) use their Elemental Bursts, the Raiden Shogun will build up Resolve stacks based on the Energy Cost of these Elemental Bursts.
The maximum number of Resolve stacks is 60.

The Resolve gained by Chakra Desiderata will be cleared 300s after the Raiden Shogun leaves the field.

**This is the Raiden Shogun's new secret technique. Abandoning the void-like "Musou," she now shoulders a new "Musou" — the dreams and ambitions of all. Just as "shinsetsu," "the truth," also means "the new," so too has Inazuma entered a new chapter.**
