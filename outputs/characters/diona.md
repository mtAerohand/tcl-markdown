### Elemental Skill: Icy Paws

Fires an Icy Paw that deals **Cryo DMG** to opponents and forms a shield on hit.
The shield's DMG Absorption scales based on Diona's Max HP, and its duration scales off the number of Icy Paws that hit their target.

**#Press**
Rapidly fires off 2 Icy Paws.

**Hold**
Dashes back quickly before firing 5 Icy Paws.
The shield created by a Hold attack will gain a 75% DMG Absorption Bonus.

The shield has a 250% **Cryo DMG** Absorption Bonus, and will cause your active character to become affected by **Cryo** at the point of formation for a short duration.

**When she first started bartending, Diona found that no matter how much ice she put in her cocktails, it would never do a drunkard any harm. That all changed when she received her Vision — now she can form ice cold enough to cause severe brainfreeze. Five out of five stars!**

**Drunken Mist**
·Deals continuous **Cryo DMG** to opponents within the AoE.
