### Elemental Skill: Artistic Ingenuity

Uses Mehrak's mapping ability for offensive purposes, initiating a radial scan that deals **AoE Dendro DMG**. It will also scan all Dendro Cores in its AoE and cause them to immediately burst.

**Mehrak was created through the modification of ancient technology and may have some other functions apart from mapping work...**

### Elemental Burst: Painted Dome

Completely unleashes Mehrak's energy and creates a cubic scanned space, dealing **AoE Dendro DMG** to all opponents within it, causing all Dendro Cores in its AoE to immediately burst, and granting Kaveh the following enhanced combat abilities for a specific duration:
·Increases Kaveh's Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attack AoE, and converts his attack DMG to **Dendro DMG** that cannot be overridden.
·All Dendro Cores created by all your own party members through Bloom reactions will deal additional DMG when they burst.
·Increases Kaveh's resistance to interruption.
These effects will be canceled once Kaveh leaves the field.
