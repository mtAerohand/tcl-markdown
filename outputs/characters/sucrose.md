### Elemental Skill: Astable Anemohypostasis Creation - 6308

Creates a small Wind Spirit that pulls opponents and objects towards its location, launches opponents within its AoE, and deals **Anemo DMG**.

**This is a little embarrassing, but though the elemental lifeforms birthed through this procedure dissipate very rapidly, they are incredibly useful when adventuring. Even failed experiments can have practical applications.**

### Elemental Burst: Forbidden Creation - Isomer 75 / Type II

Sucrose hurls an unstable concoction that creates a Large Wind Spirit.
While it persists, the Large Wind Spirit will continuously pull in surrounding opponents and objects, launch nearby opponents, and deal **Anemo DMG**.

**Elemental Absorption**
If the Wind Spirit comes into contact with **Hydro**/**Pyro**/**Cryo**/**Electro** energy, it will deal additional elemental DMG of that type.
Elemental Absorption may only occur once per use.

**Sucrose used to give names to her volatile Anemo Hypostases, but their line of heirs quickly grew to surpass Baron Bunny the 893rd.**
