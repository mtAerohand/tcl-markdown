### Elemental Skill: Passion Overload

Bennett puts all his fire and passion for adventuring into his sword. Results may vary based on how fired up he is...

**#Press**
A single, swift flame strike that deals **Pyro DMG**.

**Hold (Short)**
Charges up, resulting in different effects when unleashed based on the Charge Level.
·Level 1: Strikes twice, dealing **Pyro DMG** and launching opponents.
·Level 2: Unleashes 3 consecutive attacks that deal impressive **Pyro DMG**, but the last attack triggers an explosion that launches both Bennett and the enemy.
Bennett takes no damage from being launched.

**An attack that combines Bennett's dreams and passion with Pyro. But passion is sometimes overblown, and Pyro sometimes blows over.**

### Elemental Burst: Fantastic Voyage
