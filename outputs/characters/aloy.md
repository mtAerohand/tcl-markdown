### Elemental Skill: Frozen Wilds

Aloy throws a Freeze Bomb in the targeted direction that explodes on impact, dealing **Cryo DMG**. After it explodes, the Freeze Bomb will split up into many Chillwater Bomblets that explode on contact with opponents or after a short delay, dealing **Cryo DMG**.
When a Freeze Bomb or Chillwater Bomblet hits an opponent, the opponent's ATK is decreased and Aloy receives 1 Coil stack.
Aloy can gain up to 1 Coil stack every 0.1s.

**Coil**
·Each stack increases Aloy's Normal Attack DMG.
·When Aloy has 4 Coil stacks, all stacks of Coil are cleared. She then enters the Rushing Ice state, which further increases the DMG dealt by her Normal Attacks and converts her Normal Attack DMG to **Cryo DMG**.

While in the Rushing Ice state, Aloy cannot obtain new Coil stacks.
Coil effects will be cleared 30s after Aloy leaves combat.

**You think that's cold? Guess you've never been to The Cut.**
