### Elemental Skill: Palm Vortex

Grasping the wind's might, you form a vortex of vacuum in your palm, causing continuous **Anemo DMG** to opponents in front of you.
The vacuum vortex explodes when the skill duration ends, causing a greater amount of Anemo DMG over a larger area.

**Hold**
DMG and AoE will gradually increase.

**Elemental Absorption**
If the vortex comes into contact with **Hydro**/**Pyro**/**Cryo**/**Electro**, it will deal additional elemental DMG of that type.
Elemental Absorption may only occur once per use.

Elemental Absorption may only occur once per use.
