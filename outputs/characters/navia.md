### Elemental Skill: Ceremonial Crystalshot

When a character in the party obtains an Elemental Shard created from the Crystallize reaction, Navia will gain 1 Crystal Shrapnel stack. Navia can have up to 6 stacks of Crystal Shrapnel at once. Each time Crystal Shrapnel gain is triggered, the duration of the Crystal Shrapnel stacks you already have will be reset.
When she fires, Navia will consume all Crystal Shrapnel stacks and open her elegant yet lethal Gunbrella, firing multiple Rosula Shardshots that can penetrate opponents, dealing **Geo DMG** to opponents hit.
When 0/1/2/3 or more stacks of Crystal Shrapnel are consumed, 5/7/9/11 Rosula Shardshots will be fired respectively. The more Rosula Shardshots that strike a single opponent, the greater the DMG dealt to them. When all 11 Rosula Shardshots strike, 200% of the original amount of DMG is dealt.
In addition, when more than 3 stacks of Crystal Shrapnel are consumed, every stack consumed beyond those 3 will increase the DMG dealt by this Gunbrella attack by an additional 15%.

**Hold**
Enter Aiming Mode, continually collecting nearby Elemental Shards created by Crystallize reactions. When released, fire Rosula Shardshots with the same effect as when the skill is Tapped.

Two initial charges.

**Arkhe: Ousia**
Periodically, when Navia fires her Gunbrella, a Surging Blade will be summoned, dealing Ousia-aligned **Geo DMG**.

**"Maintaining the appropriate distance with those whom distance should be maintained is an essential part of etiquette. Naturally, there are also many ways to do this..."**
