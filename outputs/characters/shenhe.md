### Elemental Skill: Spring Spirit Summoning

The frosted dew, silvery and dense, shall exorcise all demons.
Grants all nearby party members the Icy Quill effect and deals **Cryo DMG** in different ways based on whether it is #pressed or held.

**#Press**
Rushes forward together with a Talisman Spirit, dealing **Cryo DMG** to opponents along the path.

**Hold**
Commands the Talisman Spirit to deal **AoE Cryo DMG**.

**Icy Quill**
When Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks, Elemental Skills, and Elemental Bursts deal **Cryo DMG** to opponents, the DMG dealt is increased based on Shenhe's current ATK.

The Icy Quill's effects will be cleared once its duration ends or after being triggered a certain number of times. When held rather than #pressed, the Icy Quill's effect lasts longer and can be triggered more times.
When one **Cryo DMG** instance strikes multiple opponents, the effect is triggered multiple times based on the number of opponents hit. The number of times the effect is triggered is calculated independently for each party member with the Icy Quill.

**The power of the spirits is no falsehood. Burdened with her orders, the divine maiden hurries on!**

### Elemental Burst: Divine Maiden's Deliverance

Unleashes the power of the Talisman Spirit, allowing it to roam free in this plane, dealing **AoE Cryo DMG**.
The Talisman Spirit then creates a field that decreases the **Cryo RES** and Physical RES of opponents within it. It also deals periodic **Cryo DMG** to opponents within the field.

**The way of the adepti is not defined only by the mysterious and fantastical. Only by observing the changes in the heavens and the earth, and understanding the laws of cause and effect in this realm, may its essence be understood.**
