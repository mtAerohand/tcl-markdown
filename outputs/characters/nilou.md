### Elemental Skill: Dance of Haftkarsvar

Enters the Pirouette state, dealing **Hydro DMG** to nearby opponents based on Nilou's Max HP.
While she is in the Pirouette state, Nilou's Normal Attacks and Elemental Skill will cause her to enter the Sword Dance and Whirling Steps stances respectively, causing DMG she deals to be converted to **Hydro DMG** that cannot be overridden and that is considered Elemental Skill DMG.

In these stances, Nilou's third dance step will end Pirouette, and has the following effects based on the type of said dance step:
·Sword Dance: unleashes a Luminous Illusion that deals **Hydro DMG** to opponents it touches and grants Nilou the Lunar Prayer effect. This effect converts Nilou's Normal Attacks into Sword Dance techniques, and her final hit will unleash a Luminous Illusion.
·Whirling Steps: Nilou unleashes a Whirling Water Wheel that deals **AoE Hydro DMG** and creates a Tranquility Aura that follows your active character around and applies **Wet** to opponents within its AoE.

Nilou is unable to perform Charged Attacks when under the effect of Pirouette or Lunar Prayer. These effects will be removed once she leaves the field.

**"Daintily her toes touch the water's face, and the light that ripples forth equals even the seven heavens."**

## Passive Talents

### Court of Dancing Petals

When all characters in the party are all **Dendro** or **Hydro**, and there are at least one Dendro character and one Hydro character:
The completion of the third dance step of Nilou's **Dance of Haftkarsvar** will grant all nearby characters the Golden Chalice's Bounty for 30s.
Characters under the effect of Golden Chalice's Bounty will increase the Elemental Mastery of all nearby characters by 100 for 10s whenever they are hit by **Dendro attacks**. Also, triggering the Bloom reaction will create Bountiful Cores instead of Dendro Cores.
Such Cores will burst very quickly after being created, and they have larger AoEs.
Bountiful Cores cannot trigger Hyperbloom or Burgeon, and they share an upper numerical limit with Dendro Cores. Bountiful Core DMG is considered DMG dealt by Dendro Cores produced by Bloom.
Should the party not meet the conditions for this Passive Talent, any existing Golden Chalice's Bounty effects will be canceled.
