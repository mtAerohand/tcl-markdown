## Talents

### Normal Attack: Invitation to a Beheading

**Normal Attack**
Performs up to 6 consecutive spear strikes.

**Charged Attack**
Consumes a fixed amount of Stamina, dashing toward a nearby opponent and cleaving once.
Continuously holding this button will cause Arlecchino to consume Stamina and engage in up to 5s of high-speed movement.

**Plunging Attack**
Plunges from mid-air to strike the ground below, damaging opponents along the path and dealing AoE DMG upon impact.

**Masque of the Red Death**
When Arlecchino has a Bond of Life equal to or greater than 30% of her Max HP, she will enter the "Masque of the Red Death" state, where her Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks will be converted to deal **Pyro DMG**. This cannot be overridden.
When in the "Masque of the Red Death" state, Arlecchino's Normal Attacks will deal extra DMG to opponents on hit that scales off her ATK multiplied by a certain ratio of her current Bond of Life percentage. This will consume 7.5% of said current Bond of Life. Her Bond of Life can be consumed this way every 0.03s. When her Bond of Life is consumed in this manner, All Is Ash's CD will decrease by 0.8s.

### Elemental Skill: All Is Ash

Summons forth Balemoon Bloodfire, dealing **Pyro DMG** to multiple nearby opponents and performing a dash-cleave against one of them, dealing **AoE Pyro DMG**.
Opponents hit by the aforementioned attack will have a Blood-Debt Directive applied to them.

**Blood-Debt Directive**
·Lasts 30s. Every 5s, it will deal 1 instance of **Pyro DMG** to the opponent. Max 2 instances. This DMG will be considered Elemental Skill DMG.
·When Arlecchino uses a Charged Attack or her Elemental Burst, Balemoon Rising, she will absorb and clear nearby Blood-Debt Directives. Each Directive absorbed grants her a Bond of Life worth 65% of her Max HP.
·The maximum value of the Bond of Life she can be granted through Blood-Debt Directives within 35s after using her Elemental Skill is 145% of her Max HP. Using the Elemental Skill again during this duration will restart the count on duration and the limit on the value of Bond of Life she may gain from Blood-Debt Directives.

**As she sees it, not every grain of wheat that falls upon the earth will grow into an ear, while those who obstruct her, once burned to ashes, can certainly be used to nourish flowers.**

### Elemental Burst: Balemoon Rising

Arlecchino's great wing of Balemoon Bloodfire beats as she absorbs and clears Blood-Debt Directives around her. She deals **AoE Pyro DMG** before clearing the CD of All Is Ash and healing herself. The healing is based on her Bond of Life value and ATK.

**It is commonly believed throughout Teyvat that moon phases other than the full moon are mere metaphors of ill-omen, used only by those who practice alchemy and astrology.
She saw this crimson moon in her dreams many times. Were those portents of disaster? Indeed they were, but the destined catastrophes belonged to those who enraged her.**
