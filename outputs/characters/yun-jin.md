### Elemental Skill: Opening Flourish

Ms. Yun may just be acting out fights on stage, but her skills with the spear are real enough to defend against her foes.

**#Press**
Flourishes her polearm in a cloud-grasping stance, dealing **Geo DMG**.

**Hold**
Takes up the Opening Flourish stance and charges up, forming a shield. DMG Absorption is based on Yun Jin's Max HP and has 150% effectiveness against all Elemental DMG and Physical DMG. The shield lasts until she finishes unleashing her Elemental Skill.
When the skill is released, when its duration ends, or when the shield breaks, Yun Jin will unleash the charged energy as an attack, dealing **Geo DMG**.
Based on the time spent charging, it will either unleash an attack at Charge Level 1 or Level 2.

**One glorious moment on-stage, a decade of preparation behind it.**

### Elemental Burst: Cliffbreaker's Banner

Deals **AoE Geo DMG** and grants all nearby party members a Flying Cloud Flag Formation.

**Flying Cloud Flag Formation**

**As the drums resound, as swords and halberds weave and clash, the doyenne is transformed into a mighty general.**
**As the instruments on stage strum in unison, lo, see how she vanquishes these demons!**
