### Elemental Skill: Chihayaburu

Unleashes a secret technique as fierce as the rushing wind that pulls objects and opponents towards Kazuha's current position before launching opponents within the AoE, dealing **Anemo DMG** and lifting Kazuha into the air on a rushing gust of wind.
Within 10s of remaining airborne after casting Chihayaburu, Kazuha can unleash a powerful Plunging Attack known as Midare Ranzan.

**#Press**
Can be used in mid-air.

**Hold**
Charges up before unleashing greater **Anemo DMG** over a larger AoE than #Press Mode.

**Plunging Attack: Midare Ranzan**
When a Plunging Attack is performed using the effects of the Elemental Skill Chihayaburu, Plunging Attack DMG is converted to **Anemo DMG**. On landing, Kazuha creates a small wind tunnel via a secret blade technique that pulls in nearby objects and opponents.
Midare Ranzan's DMG is considered Plunging Attack DMG.

**"Wind in branches grieves
Bygone ages, gods of old
Withered autumn leaves"**

### Elemental Burst: Kazuha Slash

The signature technique of Kazuha's self-styled bladework — a single slash that strikes with the force of the first winds of autumn, dealing **AoE Anemo DMG**.
The blade's passage will leave behind a field named "Autumn Whirlwind" that periodically deals **AoE Anemo DMG** to opponents within its range.

**Elemental Absorption**
If Autumn Whirlwind comes into contact with **Hydro**/**Pyro**/**Cryo**/**Electro**, it will deal additional elemental DMG of that type.
Elemental Absorption may only occur once per use.

**"I see eternity go by in an instant, the autumns of many years from a single leaf. Thus I shall slice this maple in a flash, and ask a question of the ages."**

## Passive Talents

### Soumon Swordsmanship
