### Elemental Skill: Salon Solitaire

Invites the guests of the Salon Solitaire to come forth and aid in Furina's performance. Will summon either the Salon Members or the Singer of Many Waters based on Furina's current **Arkhe alignment**.

**Ousia**
Foaming bubbles like celebrants shall dance, dealing **AoE Hydro DMG** based on Furina's Max HP and summoning 3 Salon Members: the Ball Octopus-shaped Gentilhomme Usher, the Bubbly Seahorse-shaped Surintendante Chevalmarin, and the Armored Crab-shaped Mademoiselle Crabaletta.
They will attack nearby opponents at intervals, prioritizing the target of the active character, dealing **Hydro** DMG based on Max HP.
When they attack, if character(s) with more than 50% HP are nearby, the Members will increase their current attack's power based on the number of such characters, and consume said characters' HP. If 1/2/3/4 (or more) characters meet these requirements, the Members' attacks will deal 110%/120%/130%/140% of their original DMG.

**Pneuma**
Summons the Singer of Many Waters, who will heal nearby active character(s) based on Max HP at intervals.

The Salon Members and Singer of Many Waters share a duration, and when Furina uses her Charged Attack to change the guest type, the new guests will inherit the remaining duration.
While the Salon Members or the Singer of Many Waters is on the field, Furina can move on the water's surface.

**A fixed roster of regulars frequent Furina's Salon Solitaire. At other times, Mademoiselle Crabaletta, Surintendante Chevalmarin, and Gentilhomme Usher shall visit, and on gloomy Wednesdays, it is the singer who comes by.**
