### Elemental Skill: Pressurized Floe

Performs an upward thrust that deals **Cryo DMG** and causes Freminet to enter Pers Timer for 10s.
While Pers Timer is active, his Elemental Skill will turn into Shattering Pressure.

**Shattering Pressure**
Executes different sorts of attacks based on the Pressure Level of Pers Timer, and then cancels Pers Timer.
·Level 0: Unleashes a vertical cut, dealing **Cryo DMG**.
·Levels 1 to 3: Unleashes a vertical cut alongside Pers, dealing **Cryo DMG** and Physical DMG. DMG dealt scales based on Pressure Level.
·Level 4: Borrows the power of a fully-pressurized Pers to deal Physical DMG. Meanwhile, Normal Attack: Flowing Eddies will be replaced by Shattering Pressure.

**Pers Timer**
When Freminet uses Normal Attacks, he will also unleash waves of frost that deal **Cryo DMG** and increase Pers's Pressure Level.
The accompanying **Cryo DMG** dealt this way is considered Elemental Skill DMG.

**Arkhe: Pneuma**
At certain intervals, after using the upward thrust, a Spiritbreath Thorn in the form of another upward thrust will be created, dealing Pneuma-aligned **Cryo DMG**.

**To immobilize one's opponent without taking their life can also be considered something of a "survival" strategy that one may choose.**
**"Pers... I leave the rest to you."**
