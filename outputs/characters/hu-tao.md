### Elemental Skill: Guide to Afterlife

Only an unwavering flame can cleanse the impurities of this world.
Hu Tao consumes a set portion of her HP to knock the surrounding enemies back and enter the Paramita Papilio state.

**Paramita Papilio**
·Increases Hu Tao's ATK based on her Max HP at the time of entering this state. ATK Bonus gained this way cannot exceed 400% of Hu Tao's Base ATK.
·Converts attack DMG to **Pyro DMG**, which cannot be overridden by any other elemental infusion.
·Charged Attacks apply the Blood Blossom effect to the enemies hit.
·Increases Hu Tao's resistance to interruption.

**Blood Blossom**
Enemies affected by Blood Blossom will take **Pyro DMG** every 4s. This DMG is considered Elemental Skill DMG.
Each enemy can be affected by only one Blood Blossom effect at a time, and its duration may only be refreshed by Hu Tao herself.

**Paramita Papilio** ends when its duration is over, or Hu Tao has left the battlefield or fallen.

**Hu Tao's Secret Spear technique is based on several rules, the first of which is: "The spear opens the path to the afterlife, and the butterflies bridge this world and the next."**

### Elemental Burst: Spirit Soother

Commands a blazing spirit to attack, dealing **Pyro DMG** in a large AoE.
Upon striking the enemy, regenerates a percentage of Hu Tao's Max HP. This effect can be triggered up to 5 times, based on the number of enemies hit.
If Hu Tao's HP is below or equal to 50% when the enemy is hit, both the DMG and HP Regeneration are increased.

**Supernatural activity by those who have already left this world is a source of great anxiety for the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. In such cases, cremation always lets Hu Tao find peace of mind. The more anxious she feels, the stronger the flame.**
