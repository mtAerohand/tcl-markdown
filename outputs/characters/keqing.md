### Elemental Skill: Stellar Restoration

Hurls a Lightning Stiletto that annihilates her opponents like the swift thunder.
When the Stiletto hits its target, it deals **Electro DMG** to opponents in a small AoE, and places a Stiletto Mark on the spot hit.

**Hold**
Hold to adjust the direction in which the Stiletto shall be thrown.
Stilettos thrown by the Hold attack mode can be suspended in mid-air, allowing Keqing to jump to them when using Stellar Restoration a second time.

**Lightning Stiletto**
 If Keqing uses Stellar Restoration again or uses a Charged Attack while its duration lasts, it will clear the Stiletto Mark and produce different effects:
·If she uses Stellar Restoration again, she will blink to the location of the Mark and unleash one slashing attack that deals **AoE Electro DMG**. When blinking to a Stiletto that was thrown from a Holding attack, Keqing can leap across obstructing terrain.
·If Keqing uses a Charged Attack, she will ignite a series of thundering cuts at the Mark's location, dealing **AoE Electro DMG**.

**"Humans are like moths, endlessly chasing the flame we call gods and adepti. But this light that I have here is my own."**
