### Elemental Skill: Sacred Rite: Heron's Sanctum

Candace's fighting style is capable of warding off an entire tide of foes.

**Tap**
Rushes forward with her shield, dealing **Hydro DMG** to opponents in front of her.

**Hold**
Raises her shield to block incoming attacks from nearby opponents, forming a barrier that absorbs DMG based on her Max HP and absorbs **Hydro DMG** 250% more effectively. This barrier lasts until the Elemental Skill is unleashed.
After holding for a certain period of time, Candace will finish charging, and when the skill button is released, the skill duration expires, or when the barrier is broken, she will perform a leaping strike that deals **Hydro DMG** to opponents in front of her.

**The oath of the guardians is more stalwart yet than the shields they inherit.**
