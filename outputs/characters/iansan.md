### Elemental Skill: Thunderbolt Rush

Iansan charges forward a certain distance, dealing Nightsoul-aligned **Electro DMG** to all opponents in her path.
After this Skill is used, Iansan will regain 54 Nightsoul points and enter the Nightsoul's Blessing state. Within 5s after this is done, using a Normal Attack will trigger 1 quick Swift Stormflight stomp from Iansan that will not consume Stamina.

**Nightsoul's Blessing: Iansan**
Continuously consumes Nightsoul points. If she runs out, or uses this Skill again, her Nightsoul's Blessing state will end. It has the following properties:
· Increases Iansan's Movement SPD.
· Holding sprint will switch Iansan to Rushing Thunderbolt mode, greatly increasing her Movement SPD temporarily. In this mode, Iansan can make flying leaps using terrain, or consume additional Nightsoul points to move on water or liquid Phlogiston while being immune to DMG from the latter.

### Elemental Burst: The Three Principles of Power

Iansan's stomping foot shatters the very earth with "Power," dealing Nightsoul-aligned **AoE Electro DMG**. She then whips out her "Limited-Edition Kinetic Energy Scale (For Workouts)."
When this Skill is used, Iansan will gain 15 Nightsoul points and enter the Nightsoul's Blessing state.
When the Kinetic Energy Scale leaves the field, Iansan's Nightsoul's Blessing state will end.

**Kinetic Energy Scale**
The Kinetic Energy Scale will follow the character around, boosting the ATK of your current active party member in different ways based on Iansan's Nightsoul points.
· If Iansan has less than 42 Nightsoul points, the ATK bonus will be based on her Nightsoul points and ATK.
· If Iansan has at least 42 Nightsoul points, the Kinetic Energy Scale will switch to the "Ardent Support!" state, in which the ATK bonus will be stronger and based on her ATK alone.
Additionally, the Scale will log the distance your current active character (excluding Iansan) has moved so long as it is active, restoring Nightsoul points to Iansan every second based on the distance moved in the previous second.
The Scale will disappear once her Nightsoul's Blessing state ends. It will also disappear after 1 second when you are not in a state of combat. While it is active, Iansan's Nightsoul's Blessing state will not end even if she is not on the field.

**"Power is not about natural talent. Power stems from unceasing practice. Power must be exercised correctly."**
