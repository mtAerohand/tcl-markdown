### Elemental Skill: Ravaging Confession

Rosaria swiftly shifts her position to appear behind her opponent, then stabs and slashes them with her polearm, dealing **Cryo DMG**.
This ability cannot be used to travel behind opponents of a larger build.

**Those who confess to Sister Rosaria will be granted no absolution. All sinners shall be met with the piercing cold of punishment proportionate to the weight of their sins.**

### Elemental Burst: Rites of Termination

Rosaria's unique take on this prayer ritual: First, she swings her weapon to slash surrounding opponents; then, she summons a frigid Ice Lance that strikes the ground. Both actions deal **Cryo DMG**.
While active, the Ice Lance periodically releases a blast of cold air, dealing **Cryo DMG** to surrounding opponents.

**Judgment is such a tedious ordeal — much easier to skip that phase and get straight to the last rites. Rosaria was never very devoted to the Anemo God anyway, which makes performing them all too easy.**
