### Elemental Skill: Rebound Hydrotherapy

Blows a **Bolstering Bubblebalm** that can stimulate blood flow and help patients drift off to sleep using a bubblegun specially made in the Fortress of Meropide.
Bolstering Bubblebalms will bounce between nearby opponents, dealing **Hydro DMG** based on Sigewinne's max HP to opponents it hits. When it bounces, it will restore HP to all nearby party members except Sigewinne herself. The amount healed is based on Sigewinne's max HP.
After bouncing 5 times, the Bolstering Bubblebalm will disappear and restore HP to Sigewinne based on her max HP value.
When no opponents are present, the Bolstering Bubblebalm will bounce nearby. Only one Bolstering Bubblebalm created by a Sigewinne may exist at once.
When Held, the Bolstering Bubblebalm can be boosted to an even bigger size.

**Hold**
Enter Aiming Mode to begin blowing an even bigger, even more breathtaking Bolstering Bubblebalm!
The Bolstering Bubblebalm will grow bigger the longer the skill is Held, until it grows up to two tiers in size. Each tier it grows increases its DMG by 5% and healing by 5%. When a Bolstering Bubblebalm bounces, it will drop down a tier in size, until it returns to being a normal Bolstering Bubblebalm.
After weaker opponents are hit by big Bolstering Bubblebalms, they will be imprisoned and will be unable to move.

In addition, 2 Sourcewater Droplets will be created near Sigewinne when she uses this Skill. Each Sourcewater Droplet Sigewinne collects will grant her a Bond of Life worth 10% of her Max HP.
When Sigewinne's Bond of Life is cleared, she regains 1 Elemental Energy for every 2,000 HP worth of the Bond of Life that was cleared. Sigewinne can regain up to 5 Elemental Energy in this way.

**Arkhe: Ousia**
Bolstering Bubblebalms periodically call down a Surging Blade on the position they hit, dealing Ousia-aligned **Hydro DMG** based on Sigewinne's max HP.

**"What do you think? Not only can this kind of hydrotherapy stimulate the circulatory system, but it can also cheer patients up, ooh, and that's not all, it can even help patients who ought to get some rest have a nice nap..."**

### Elemental Burst: Super Saturated Syringing

## Passive Talents

### Requires Appropriate Rest

Sigewinne grants herself the "Semi-Strict Bedrest" effect for 18s after using **Rebound Hydrotherapy**: Sigewinne gains an 8% **Hydro DMG Bonus** and 10 stacks of Convalescence. When the Elemental Skills of your nearby off-field party members other than Sigewinne deal DMG, consume 1 stack of Convalescence, and increase the DMG dealt by this instance of Elemental Skill DMG. Every 1,000 Max HP Sigewinne has above 30,000 increases the DMG by 80. The maximum DMG increase for Elemental Skills that can be gained in this way is 2,800.

### Detailed Diagnosis, Thorough Treatment

When Sigewinne performs healing, the amount healed for this instance is increased based on the total current value of the Bonds of Life on all party members: For each 1,000 HP worth of Bonds of Life, the outgoing healing is increased by 3%. The amount of healing provided can be increased by up to 30% in this way.

### Emergency Dose

While underwater, heals your active character over 2.5s when their HP falls under 50%. The amount healed is equal to 50% of their Max HP, and their All Elemental and Physical RES will be decreased by 10% for 10s. This effect can be triggered up to once every 20s.
