## Talents

### Normal Attack: Card Force Translocation

**Normal Attack**
Performs up to 4 consecutive shots with a bow.

**Plunging Attack**
Fires off a shower of arrows in mid-air before falling and striking the ground, dealing AoE DMG upon impact.

**Charged Attack**
Performs a more precise **Aimed Shot** with increased DMG.
While aiming, flames will run across the arrowhead before being fired. Different effects will occur based on the time spent charging.
·Charge Level 1: Fires off a Pyro-infused arrow, dealing **Pyro DMG**.
·Charge Level 2: Fires off a Prop Arrow that deals **Pyro DMG**, and upon hit, it will summon a Grin-Malkin Hat.
When firing the Prop Arrow, and when Lyney has more than 60% HP, he will consume a portion of his HP to obtain 1 Prop Surplus stack. Max 5 stacks. The effect will be removed after the character spends 30s out of combat.
The lowest Lyney can drop to through this method is 60% of his Max HP.

**Grin-Malkin Hat**
·Can taunt nearby opponents and attract their attacks. Each opponent can only be taunted by the Hat once every 5s.
·The Hat will inherit a percentage of Lyney's Max HP.
·If destroyed, or if its duration expires, it will fire off a **Pyrotechnic Strike** at 1 nearby opponent, dealing **Pyro DMG**.
Only 1 Hat can exist at any given time.

**Arkhe: Pneuma**
At certain intervals, the Prop Arrow will cause a Spiritbreath Thorn to descend upon its hit location, dealing Pneuma-aligned **Pyro DMG**.

### Elemental Skill: Bewildering Lights

Lyney does a flourish with his hat, unleashing a firework surprise!
When used, he will clear all current Prop Surplus stacks and deal **AoE Pyro DMG** to opponents in front of him. DMG will be increased according to the stacks cleared, and this will also regenerate Lyney's HP based on his Max HP.

When a Grin-Malkin Hat created by Lyney is on the field, the fireworks will cause it to explode, dealing **AoE Pyro DMG** equal to that of a Pyrotechnic Strike.
The DMG dealt through the Grin-Malkin Hat in this way is considered Charged Attack DMG.

**"Everyone knows that magicians will intentionally misdirect the audience... Ah, yes, while you were looking my way, the hat and assistant over there have both disappeared... Fascinating, is it not?"**

### Elemental Burst: Wondrous Trick: Miracle Parade

Unleashing his magic, Lyney turns himself into a Grin-Malkin Cat that can move around quickly. (Not to be mistaken for the Grin-Malkin Hat. They're two different props!)
When the Grin-Malkin Cat gets close to opponents, it will send flames falling down on them, dealing at most 1 instance of **Pyro DMG** to each opponent. When the duration ends, he will dismiss the Grin-Malkin Cat and ignite fireworks that deal **AoE Pyro DMG**, summon 1 Grin-Malkin Hat, and grant himself 1 Prop Surplus stack.

Grin-Malkin Cat can be actively canceled.

**"Watch closely now. This is a time for miracles, and it belongs to just the two of us!"**
