### Elemental Skill: Airborne Disease Prevention

It's time for the real bash bros to step up! Ifa calls Cacucu in as backup.
After using this skill, Ifa gains 80 Nightsoul points and enters the **Nightsoul's Blessing** state. In the Nightsoul's Blessing state, Ifa will hover with Cacucu's help. When he uses Normal Attacks in this state, he will use different kinds of **Supporting Fire** depending on whether you Tap or Hold, firing Tonicshots that are capable of healing all party members.

Additionally, Holding the Elemental Skill **Airborne Disease Prevention** while Ifa is in Nightsoul's Blessing will cause him to use a Nightsoul-aligned Plunging Attack. Letting go of the skill button will interrupt this Plunging Attack to maintain his hover. If Ifa lands due to this Plunging Attack, his Nightsoul's Blessing state will end.
