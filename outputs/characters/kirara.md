### Elemental Skill: Meow-teor Kick

**#Press**
Leaps into the air with all the agility of a cat passing through the bushes, and thwacks her foes with a flying kick that deals **AoE Dendro DMG** while creating a Shield of Safe Transport. This will also briefly **apply Dendro** to Kirara. The shield will absorb **Dendro DMG** with 250% effectiveness. The shield's DMG absorption will be based on Kirara's Max HP and will not exceed a certain percentage of that Max HP. The remaining DMG absorption on a Shield of Safe Transport will stack on a new one when it is created, and its duration will reset.

**Hold**
Out of her desire to "deliver within half a day," Kirara deploys a Shield of Safe Transport identical to the one that can be created by #pressing the skill. She will also curl up into a special express delivery box, entering the Urgent Neko Parcel state in order to move and fight more swiftly.

**Urgent Neko Parcel**
· Deals **Dendro DMG** to opponents she crashes into. This effect can be triggered once on each opponent every 0.5s.
· When in this state, Kirara's movement speed, climbing speed, and jumping power are all increased, and her Stamina Consumption from climbing is increased.
· When the duration ends or the skill is used again, a Flipclaw Strike more powerful than the attack in the #Press Mode will be unleashed, dealing **AoE Dendro DMG**.
· The Urgent Neko Parcel state lasts a maximum of 10s. When the state ends, the skill will enter CD. The longer Kirara spends in this state, the longer the CD will be.
· Sprinting or actively canceling climbing will end this state early.

**"So you wanna know the secret to speedy deliveries? Well, it's all in the legs!"**

### Elemental Burst: Secret Art: Surprise Dispatch

Smash opponents with a Special Delivery Package used for punishing parcel thieves, dealing **AoE Dendro DMG**. After the Special Delivery Package explodes, it will split up into many **Cat Grass Cardamoms** that will explode either upon contact with opponents or after a period of time, dealing **AoE Dendro DMG**.

**"Hehe, that's right, this stuff was made to deal with those parcel thieves! Remember to leave a 5-star rating once you've received yours!"**

## Passive Talents

### Bewitching, Betwitching Tails

When Kirara is in the Urgent Neko Parcel state of **Meow-teor Kick**, each impact against an opponent will grant her a stack of **Reinforced Packaging**. This effect can be triggered once for each opponent hit every 0.5s. Max 3 stacks. When the Urgent Neko Parcel state ends, each stack of Reinforced Packaging will create 1 Shield of Safe Transport for Kirara. The shields that are created this way will have 20% of the DMG absorption that the Shield of Safe Transport produced by **Meow-teor Kick** would have. If Kirara is already protected by a Shield of Safe Transport created by Meow-teor Kick, its DMG absorption will stack with these shields and its duration will reset.

### Pupillary Variance

Every 1,000 Max HP Kirara possesses will increase the DMG dealt by **Meow-teor Kick** by 0.4%, and the DMG dealt by **Secret Art: Surprise Dispatch** by 0.3%.
