Summons forth countless lovely dreams and nightmares that pull in nearby objects and opponents, dealing **AoE Anemo DMG** and summoning a Mini Baku.

**Mini Baku:**
Follows the current active character. At regular intervals, the Mini Baku will create 1 Yumemi Style Special Snack nearby. After one of your own party members picks up a Special Snack, if their HP is higher than 70%, the Snack will explode and unleash a Munen Shockwave, dealing 1 instance of **AoE Anemo DMG** to nearby opponents. Otherwise, it will heal the character who picked it up based on Yumemizuki Mizuki's Elemental Mastery.

If a Snack is not picked up after a period of time, it will explode and release a Munen Shockwave, dealing 1 instance of **AoE Anemo DMG** to surrounding opponents.

**"If you bury dark emotions for too long, they will become nightmares. With that in mind, why don't we turn them into 'delicious snacks' while we've got the time?"**
