### Elemental Skill: Tengu Stormcall

Retreats rapidly with the speed of a tengu, summoning the protection of the Crowfeather.
Gains Crowfeather Cover for 18s, and when Kujou Sara fires a fully-charged Aimed Shot, Crowfeather Cover will be consumed, and will leave a Crowfeather at the target location.
Crowfeathers will trigger Tengu Juurai: Ambush after a short time, dealing **Electro DMG** and granting the active character within its AoE an ATK Bonus based on Kujou Sara's Base ATK.

The ATK Bonuses from different Tengu Juurai will not stack, and their effects and duration will be determined by the last Tengu Juurai to take effect.

**The tengu race have never lacked for exceptional talents who have received an Electro Vision. It's just that they often habitually chant praises to the Electro Archon while manipulating Electro. The chants go something like this**
**"Show forth your might, O praiseworthy Narukami, and grant this supplicant your thunderous might! Sowaka!"**

The ATK Bonus provided by various kinds of Tengu Juurai will not stack, and their effects and duration will be determined by the last Tengu Juurai to take effect.
