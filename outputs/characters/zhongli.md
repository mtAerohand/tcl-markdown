### Elemental Skill: Dominus Lapidis

Every mountain, rock and inch of land is filled with the power of Geo, but those who can wield such powers freely are few and far between.

**#Press**
Commands the power of earth to create a Stone Stele.

**Hold**
Causes nearby Geo energy to explode, causing the following effects:
·If their maximum number hasn't been reached, creates a Stone Stele.
·Creates a shield of jade. The shield's DMG Absorption scales based on Zhongli's Max HP.
·Deals **AoE Geo DMG**.
·If there are nearby targets with the **Geo element**, it will drain a large amount of **Geo element** from a maximum of 2 such targets. This effect does not cause DMG.

**Stone Stele**
When created, deals **AoE Geo DMG**.
Additionally, it will intermittently resonate with other nearby **Geo constructs**, dealing **Geo DMG** to nearby opponents.
The Stone Stele is considered a **Geo construct** that can both be climbed and used to block attacks.
Only one Stele created by Zhongli himself may initially exist at any one time.

**Jade Shield**
Possesses 150% DMG Absorption against all Elemental and Physical DMG.
Characters protected by the Jade Shield will decrease the Elemental RES and Physical RES of opponents in a small AoE by 20%. This effect cannot be stacked.
