### Elemental Skill: Short-Range Rapid Interdiction Fire

Chevreuse quickly shoulders her musket and fires at her opponent(s), dealing **AoE Pyro DMG**.
For a short duration after Chevreuse fires a shot, she will continuously restore HP to your active character on the field. The amount healed is based on her Max HP.
Hold to fire in a different fashion.

**Hold**
Enter Aiming Mode, locking a target in her sights to fire a precise interdiction shot. If Chevreuse has an Overcharged Ball, then she will fire the Overcharged Ball instead, dealing greater **Pyro DMG** in a larger area.
Chevreuse gains 1 Overcharged Ball every time a nearby character in the party triggers an Overloaded reaction, and can have up to 1 Overcharged Ball at a time.

**Arkhe: Ousia**
Periodically, after Chevreuse's Short-Range Rapid Interdiction Fire hits, a Surging Blade will be called forth that deals Ousia-aligned **Pyro DMG**.

**"Actually, training regulations only had the phrase "interdiction fire," but the protagonist of this novel believes that even how stylish your terminology is can affect how motivated your troops are, which can put your opponents on the back foot right from the get-go... I think that's a good point, so I changed the regulations!"**

### Elemental Burst: Ring of Bursting Grenades

Chevreuse fires an explosive grenade at opponents with her musket, dealing **AoE Pyro DMG.** After the projectile hits, it will split into many secondary explosive shells.
The secondary explosive shells will burst after a short interval, dealing **Pyro DMG** to nearby opponents.

**"Theoretically, a rectangular blast would be most efficient at destroying enemy formations. Unfortunately, the cross-section of an explosive shock wave is round, like most cakes. So, the secondary explosive shells can only be arranged like the fruit on a cake, forming a ring around the edge."**

## Passive Talents

### Vanguard's Coordinated Tactics

When all party members are **Pyro** and **Electro** characters and there is at least one Pyro and one Electro character each in the party:
Chevreuse grants "Coordinated Tactics" to nearby party members: After a character triggers the Overloaded reaction, the **Pyro** and **Electro** RES of the opponent(s) affected by this Overloaded reaction will be decreased by 40% for 6s.
The "Coordinated Tactics" effect will be removed when the Elemental Types of the characters in the party do not meet the basic requirements for the Passive Talent.

### Vertical Force Coordination

After Chevreuse fires an Overcharged Ball using **Short-Range Rapid Interdiction Fire**, nearby **Pyro** and **Electro** characters in the party gain 1% increased ATK for every 1,000 Max HP Chevreuse has for 30s. ATK can be increased by up to 40% in this way.

### Double Time March

Decreases sprinting Stamina consumption for your own party members by 20%.
Not stackable with Passive Talents that provide the exact same effects.
