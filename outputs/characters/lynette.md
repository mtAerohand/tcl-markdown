### Elemental Skill: Enigmatic Feint

Flicks her mantle and executes an Enigma Thrust, dealing **Anemo DMG**.
When the Enigma Thrust hits an opponent, it will restore Lynette's HP based on her Max HP, and in the 4s afterward, she will lose a certain amount of HP per second.
Based on whether you #press or hold this ability, she will use Enigma Thrust differently.

**#Press**
She swiftly uses an Enigma Thrust.

**Hold**
Lynette will enter a high-speed Pilfering Shadow state and apply Shadowsign to a nearby opponent. You can control her movement direction during this state, and you can end it prematurely by using this skill again.
When this high-speed state ends, Lynette will unleash her Enigma Thrust. If there is an opponent with Shadowsign applied to them nearby, Lynette will approach them in a flash before using Enigma Thrust.

A maximum of 1 opponent can have Shadowsign at any one time. When this opponent gets too far from Lynette, the Shadowsign will be canceled.

**Arkhe: Ousia**
At specific intervals, Lynette will unleash a Surging Blade when she uses Enigma Thrust, dealing Ousia-aligned **Anemo DMG**.

**"Now then, turn your eyes to the stage and continue to enjoy the performance. When I next appear, I'll be where you least expect."**
