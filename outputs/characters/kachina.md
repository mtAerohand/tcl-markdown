### Elemental Skill: Go, Go Turbo Twirly!

Fight alongside the turbo trusty Turbo Twirly!
Summons Turbo Twirly. When the skill is Held and released, Kachina will summon and ride Turbo Twirly.
After the Skill is used, Kachina will gain 60 Nightsoul points and enter the Nightsoul's Blessing state.

**Nightsoul's Blessing: Kachina**
Turbo Twirly's various actions consume Kachina's Nightsoul points.
The Nightsoul's Blessing state will end when these points have been depleted.

**Turbo Twirly**
Can exist independently or be ridden and operated by Kachina. When Turbo Twirly is present, Kachina's Elemental Skill, "Go, Go Turbo Twirly!", will change to an option to Mount/Dismount Turbo Twirly.
·When present independent of Kachina, it will slam the ground at intervals, dealing Nightsoul-aligned **AoE Geo DMG** based on Kachina's DEF.
·When Kachina is riding Turbo Twirly, she can control it to move and climb swiftly, and use Normal Attacks to slam the ground, dealing Nightsoul-aligned **AoE Geo DMG** based on Kachina's DEF.

Turbo Twirly will disappear once Kachina's Nightsoul's Blessing state ends, and it is considered a Geo Construct. Only 1 Turbo Twirly created by Kachina herself can exist on the field at any one time.

**Turbo Twirly only looks like a top — it is, in fact, a drill that can split even the strongest rock asunder!**

### Elemental Burst: Time to Get Serious!

Striking the ground, Kachina deals **AoE Geo DMG** based on her DEF and creates a Turbo Drill Field.
The Field increases Turbo Twirly's attack AoE and its Movement SPD when Kachina is riding it.

If Kachina's own Turbo Twirly is present when this is used, the Turbo Twirly will be summoned to her side.

**Just as nervous performers might imagine audience members as wooden puppets, Kachina imagines that her opponents are the loveliest of gem-bearing ores — the kind you'd be proud to bring home and hoard.**
