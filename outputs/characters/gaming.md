### Elemental Skill: Bestial Ascent

Pounces forward using the Wushou arts, leaping high into the air after coming into contact with a target or surface.
After Gaming has used Bestial Ascent to rise into the air, if he immediately uses a Plunging Attack, he will use the especially powerful Plunging Attack: Charmed Cloudstrider instead.

**Plunging Attack: Charmed Cloudstrider**
The DMG from Plunging Attacks caused by Bestial Ascent is converted to **Pyro DMG** that cannot be overridden by other elemental infusions. Upon landing, Gaming will consume a fixed amount of HP. Gaming's HP cannot be reduced below 10% by this method.
Charmed Cloudstrider DMG is considered Plunging Attack DMG.

**"Auspicious beasts leap high to pluck the greens — that symbolizes good fortune and knowing how to make some serious green, y'know — so may we all rise to new heights, one step at a time!"**

### Elemental Burst: Suanni's Gilded Dance

Gaming enters Wushou Stance, briefly applying **Pyro** to him, recovering a fixed amount of HP, and summons his companion, the Suanni Man Chai, to smash into his target, dealing **AoE Pyro DMG**.
After bashing its target, Man Chai will roll to a nearby location before moving towards Gaming. When it links up with Gaming, Man Chai will leave the field and reset the CD for Gaming's Elemental Skill, Bestial Ascent.
While Wushou Stance is active, his resistance to interruption is increased, and when Gaming lands with Charmed Cloudstrider attack or completes the forward pounce attack from Bestial Ascent with over 50% HP, he will summon Man Chai again.
Each Gaming can only have 1 Man Chai on the field simultaneously.
This effect will be canceled once Gaming leaves the field.

**"The gilded Suanni spits out fortune like a fireworks show! Hey, now that's what's called prosperity, when business is really 'booming'!"**
